# PersonalWebsite
This is a Spring Boot Application for my personal website

# How to start the application
You need to have Maven installed. The Spring Boot Maven plugin includes a ```run``` goal that can be used to compile and run the application. The Maven command
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
is used to start the application.
